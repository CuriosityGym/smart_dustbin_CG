# smart_dustbin_CG
This is the Smart Bin made for schools and colleges as a PBL and NOT the SPJIMR Bin.
There are two parts to this. The adafruit code is the one with the dashboard setup and the other smart bin code is the one with the ultrasonic distance sensor. Both these codes have to be uploaded to an ESP and an arduino.
